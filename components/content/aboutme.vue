              <h2>About Me</h2>
              <p>
                I spend my days designing web and mobile apps, but an incredible part of my time and energy is focused on being a better photographer. Learning the fundamentals of photography took me a very long time before it clicked for me. From that time, I have been driven to learn more and more about how to make great images and how to tell small stories with those images. I am married to a wonderful woman, Nicole, who never complains or shames me when I want to take photos. For that, I am incredibly grateful.
