# People
 Photographing people has always been important to me since beginning taking pictures. There is such a power in capturing the beauty of humanity through this medium. Most of the people you’ll see in these photos are great friends of mine, but some of them are strangers or maybe people I met only one time. Creating this book made me recognize my tendencies in regards to how I like to photograph people. I like for peoples faces to fill the frame, I love capturing joy and personality, and people’s expression is what’s most important to me. Sometimes whenever I’m in a crowd, I get struck by how many people are surrounding me and I find myself thinking that each one of these people was created and loved and has their own unique humanity and expression. Making photos of people is my attempt to reveal that expression though an image and to affirm the humanity and goodness inside of each of us.
