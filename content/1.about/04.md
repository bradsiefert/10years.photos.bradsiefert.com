## Day 1 of 3653
On February 14th of 2007 I took my first serious photographs. At that time of my life I was pursuing, with everything I could, becoming a professional musician alongside my dear friend Will McNair. Will and I had worked long and hard for several years, and a few weeks earlier, Will had received an interesting opportunity. Will was given the opportunity to apply to be an A&R at at major record company. Part of the application process required that he develop two artists and present them to the record company. He found two artists, began writing music for them and developing them as artists. Very quickly we realized that he would need professional (or at least something that could pass as professional) photos of the artists. Being the diligent right-hand man that I am, we booked a photoshoot, I bought a DSLR on craigslist (a Nikon D50), and a lens the morning of the shoot (18-55mm f/3.5-5.6). I honestly didn’t have any idea what I was doing; all I knew was that I should shoot as much as I could and constantly check the back of the camera to make sure I was at least getting something that looked alright (little has changed). We shot for a few hours and by the end I was quite tired, but whenever we got back to the house and reviewed the photos, I knew that I had started something that I would spend a lifetime pursuing.

This photography is an outtake from the day, one of the artist’s cousins acting silly. I didn’t even have this file on my computer anymore, I had to download it from my old Flickr account. It’s far from the best photograph that I’ve ever taken, but it represents the beginning of something new and the first steps towards what my life has now become.
