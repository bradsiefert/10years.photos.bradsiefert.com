## Ten years in.

Photography for me is about stealing moments to be remembered. My work isn’t really fine art, it is an exercise in being present. For many people I’ve met, staying present requires them to put their devices down. For me though, I’ve found that I’m most happy whenever I’ve found the courage to pick up my camera and capture the moment in front of me. The times I most regret are when I forgot my camera at home, or don’t have the courage or forethought to take the camera out of my backpack. I have lumped my work into three kinds of work: places, people, and instant film. I’m certainly not an expert or a master in any of these fields, but I’m proud of the way that I’ve grown in competency in each of these disciplines of photography. I’m not usually a person who struggles to step out and share my work with the world, but making this book has unearthed all sorts of resistance in my heart and mind around putting this work out into the world as a book. I had to fight through the idea that with this book I’m making a statement about my skill, competency, or vision with my work. More than anything, I simply love this work and am proud of it, and I wanted to honor and share the work with whomever would like to enjoy it, because it is deeply important to me. I hope that you feel something about the humanity represented inside of this book and that you know a bit more about my last 10 years as a photographer. Putting this book together is an opportunity for me to look back at the work I’ve done and to crystallize it by putting it on paper. I hope that you enjoy and are moved by this decade’s work.

Let’s all meet up again in another 10 years.
