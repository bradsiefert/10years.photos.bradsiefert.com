### Thank Yous

I'm indebted to the beautiful work created by my friends [Eric](http://www.ericryananderson.com/), [Anthony](http://www.anthonybarlich.com/), [Nathanael](http://www.nathanaelfilbert.com/), Devin, Jason, Josh, [Lawrence](https://www.instagram.com/lawrenceagyei/), [Ting](http://ting-shen.com/), and the many, many conversations with these friends and others that have inspired me and pushed me to be better. Thank you to [Nicole](https://www.instagram.com/nicsiefert/), to [Will](http://www.the83rd.com/), my parents, my New York friends, [David Buth](http://www.summerjourneys.org/), and the community of photographers in Chicago that I happened to fall into. Special thanks to everyone I photographed in this book. It means the world to have photographs of you on hard drive.

In making this book, I had to put aside thoughts of hubris and imposture syndrome at every step to make this happen. It would give me great joy if someone found this book and was inspired to create their own photobook or simply to create something at all. The whole world benefits when anyone perseveres to create what is on their heart. This is my attempt to do just that. Thank you for taking the time to read it.
